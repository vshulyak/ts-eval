---
A set of tools to make time series analysis easier.

## 🧩 Current features

* **N-step ahead time series evaluation** – using a Jupyter widget.
* **Friedman / Nemenyi rank test (posthoc)** – to see which model statistically performs better.
* **Relative Metrics** – rMSE, rMAE + Forecasted Value analogues.
* **Prediction Interval Metrics** – MIS, rMIS, FVrMIS
* **Fixed fourier series generation**  – fixed in time according to pandas index
* **Naive/Seasonal models for baseline predictions** (with prediction intervals)
* **Statsmodels n-step evaluation** – helper functions to evaluate n-step ahead forecasts using Statsmodels models or naive/seasonal naive models.

## 👩🏾‍🎨 Widget Preview

In:
```
TSMetrics(target, sm_seas, default)
.use_reference(snaive)
.for_horizons(0, 1, 5, 23)
.for_time_slices(time_slices.all, time_slices.weekend)
.with_description()
.with_prediction_rankings(mtx.FVrMSE, mtx.FVrMIS)
.with_predictions_plot()
.show()
```

## 👩🏾‍🚒 Demo
For a more elaborate example, please check out the [Demo Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/vshulyak/ts-eval/blob/master/examples/basic_usage.ipynb).

## 🤦🏾‍ Motivation

While working on a long term time series analysis project, I had a need to summarize and store performance metrics
of different models and compare them. As it's daunting to do this across dozens of notebooks, I huddled over some code
to do what I want in a few lines of code.

## 👩🏾‍🚀 Installation

      pip install ts-eval


## 📋 Release Planning:

* **Release 0.3**
  * travis: add 3.8 default python when it's available
  * docs: supported metrics & API options
  * Maybe use api like Summary in statsmodels MLEModel class, it has extend methods and warn/info messages
  * pretty legend for lots like here https://studywolf.wordpress.com/2017/11/21/matplotlib-legends-for-mean-and-confidence-interval-plots/
  * Look for TODOs
  * changable colors
  * turn off colored display option
  * a nicer API for raw metrics container
  * codacy badge
  * violin plots to compare predictions – areas can be colored, different metrics on left and right (like relative...)
* **Release 0.4**
  * holiday/fourier features model
  * fix viz module to have less of important stuff
  * a gif with project visualization
  * check shapes of input arrays (target vs preds), now it doesn't raise an error
  * Baseline prediction using target dataset (without explicit calculation, but losing some time points)

## 💡 Ideas

* components
  * Graph: Visualize outliers from confidence interval
  * Multi-comparison component: scikit_posthocs lib or homecooked?
  * inspect true confidence interval coverage via sampling (was done in postings around bayesian dropout sampling)
  * xarrays: compare if compared datasets are actually equal (offets by dates, shapes, maybe even hashing)
  * bin together step performance, like steps 0-1, 2-5, 6-12, 13-24
  * highlight regions using a mask (holidays, etc.)
  * option to view interactively points using widget (plotly)?
  * diagnostics: bias to over / underestimate points
  * animated graphs for change in seasonality
* features
  * example notebook for fourier?
  * tests for fourier
  * nint generation
* utils:
  * model adaptor (for different models, generic) which generates 3d prediction dataset. For stastmodels using dyn forecast or kalman filter
  * future importance calculator, but only if I can manipulate input features
  * feature selection using PACF / prewhiten?
* project
  * more defensive style (add arg checks, so it's easier to understand what is going on)
  * docstrings
  * circleci
  * https://timothycrosley.github.io/portray/ for docs
* sMAPE & MASE can be added for the jupyter evaluation tables
* ? Residual stats: since I have residuals => Ljung-Box, Heteroscedasticity test, Jarque-Bera – like in statsmodels results,
  but probably these stats were inspected already by the user... and on which step should they be computed then?


## 🤹🏼‍♂️ Development

Recommended development workflow:
```
pipenv install -e .[dev]
pipenv shell
```
The library doesn't use Flit/Poetry, so the suggested workflow is based on Pipenv (as per https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/1911).
Pipfile* are ignored in the .gitignore.
